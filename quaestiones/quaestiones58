There is BST given with the root node with the key part as an integer only. You need to find the in-order successor and predecessor of a given key. If either predecessor or successor is not found, then set it to NULL.

Note:- In an inorder traversal the number just smaller than the target is the predecessor and the number just greater than the target is the successor
