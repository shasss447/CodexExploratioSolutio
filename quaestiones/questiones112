Given a weighted, undirected and connected graph of V vertices and an adjacency list adj where adj[i] is a list of lists containing two integers where the first integer of each list j denotes there is edge between i and j , second integers corresponds to the weight of that  edge . You are given the source vertex S and You to Find the shortest distance of all the vertex's from the source vertex S. You have to return a list of integers denoting shortest distance between each node and Source vertex S.
 

Note: The Graph doesn't contain any negative weight cycle.
