You are given N identical eggs and you have access to a K-floored building from 1 to K.

There exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= K such that any egg dropped from a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped from or below floor f will not break.
There are few rules given below. 

An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
A broken egg must be discarded.
The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
If the egg doesn't break at a certain floor, it will not break at any floor below.
If the eggs breaks at a certain floor, it will break at any floor above.
Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
